Mwifi API
==========

``Mwifi`` (Wi-Fi Mesh) is the encapsulation of `ESP-WIFI-MESH APIs <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-reference/mesh/index.html>`_, and it adds to ESP-WIFI-MESH the retransmission filter, data compression, fragmented transmission, and P2P multicast features.

.. ---------------------- Mwifi Features --------------------------

.. _Mwif-Features:

Features
---------

1. **Retransmission filter**: As ESP-WIFI-MESH won't perform data flow control when transmitting data downstream, there will be redundant fragments in case of unstable network or wireless interference. For this, Mwifi adds a 16-bit ID to each fragment, and the redundant fragments with the same ID will be discarded.
2. **Fragmented transmission**: When the data packet exceeds the limit of the maximum packet size, Mwifi splits it into fragments before they are transmitted to the target device for reassembly.
3. **Data compression**: When the packet of data is in Json and other similar formats, this feature can help reduce the packet size and therefore increase the packet transmitting speed. 
4. **P2P multicast**: As the multicasting in ESP-WIFI-MESH may cause packet loss, Mwifi uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) multicasting method to ensure a much more reliable delivery of data packets.

.. ---------------------- Writing a Mesh Application --------------------------

.. _Mwifi-writing-mesh-application:

Writing Applications
--------------------

Mwifi supports using ESP-WIFI-MESH under self-organized mode, where only the root node that serves as a gateway of Mesh network can require the LwIP stack to transmit/receive data to/from an external IP network.

Mwifi also supports the way to fix the root node. In this case, the nodes in the entire ESP-WIFI-MESH network cannot communicate with the external IP network through wifi. If you need to communicate with the external IP network, you need to use other methods.

If you want to call Wi-Fi API to connect/disconnect/scan, please pause Mwifi first. Self organized networking must be disabled before the application calls any Wi-Fi driver APIs.


.. _mesh-initialize-Mwifi:

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wi-Fi Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""
Prior to the use of Mwifi, Wi-Fi must be initialized.
``esp_wifi_set_ps`` (indicates whether Mesh network enters into sleep mode) and ``esp_mesh_set_6m_rate`` (indicates the minimum packet transmittig speed) must be set before ``esp_wifi_start``.


The following code snippet demonstrates how to initialize Wi-Fi.

.. code-block:: c

    wifi_init_config_t cfg = WIFI_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT();

    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(nvs_flash_init());

    tcpip_adapter_init();
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_event_loop_init(NULL, NULL));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_wifi_init(&cfg));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_wifi_set_storage(WIFI_STORAGE_RAM));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_wifi_set_mode(WIFI_MODE_STA));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_mesh_set_6m_rate(false));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(esp_wifi_start());

"""""""""""""""""""""
In general, you don't need to modify Mwifi and just use its default configuration. But if you want to modify it, you may use ``make menuconfig``. See the detailed configuration below:

    Parameters              Description
    ======================  ====================

    vote_max_count          Max multiple voting each device can have for the self-healing of a MESH network
    backoff_rssi            RSSI threshold below which connections to the root node are not allowed
    scan_min_count          The minimum number of times a device should scan the beacon frames from other devices before it becomes a root node

.. code-block:: c

    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mwifi_init(&cfg));


.. _mesh-configuring-Mwifi:

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The modified Mwifi configuration will only be effective after Mwifi is rebooted.

You may configure Mwifi by using the struct mwifi_config_t. See the configuration parameters below:

    ======================  ====================
    Parameters              Description
    ======================  ====================
    router_ssid             SSID of the router
    router_password         Router password
    router_bssid            BSSID is equal to the router's MAC address. This field must be
                            configured if more than one router shares the same SSID. You
                            can avoid using BSSIDs by setting up a unique SSID for each
                            router. This field must also be configured if the router is hidden

    mesh_id                 Mesh network ID. Nodes sharing the same MESH ID
                            can communicate with one another
    mesh_password           Password for secure communication between devices in a MESH network
    mesh_type               Only MESH_IDLE, MESH_ROOT, and MESH_NODE device types are supported.
                            MESH_ROOT and MESH_NODE are only used for routerless solutions
    channel                 Mesh network and the router will be on the same channel
    channel_switch_disable  If this value is not set, when "attempt" (mwifi_init_config_t) times is reached, 
                            device will change to a full channel scan for a network that could join.
    router_switch_disable   If the BSSID is specified and this value is not also set, when the router of this specified BSSID
                            fails to be found after "attempt" (mwifi_init_config_t) times, the whole network is allowed to switch
                            to another router with the same SSID.
    ======================  ====================


The following code snippet demonstrates how to configure Mwifi.

.. code-block:: c

    mwifi_config_t config = {
        .router_ssid     = CONFIG_ROUTER_SSID,
        .router_password = CONFIG_ROUTER_PASSWORD,
        .mesh_id         = CONFIG_MESH_ID,
        .mesh_password   = CONFIG_MESH_PASSWORD,
        .mesh_type       = CONFIG_MESH_TYPE,
        .channel         = CONFIG_ROUTER_CHANNEL,
    };

    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mwifi_set_config(&config));


.. _mesh-start-Mwifi:

Start Mwifi
^^^^^^^^^^^
After starting Mwifi, the application should check for Mwifi events to determine when it has connected to the network.

1. MDF_EVENT_MWIFI_ROOT_GOT_IP: the root node gets the IP address and can communicate with the external network;
2. MDF_EVENT_MWIFI_PARENT_CONNECTED: connects with the parent node for data communication between devices.

.. code-block:: c

    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mdf_event_loop_init(event_loop_cb));
    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mwifi_start());

.. --------------------- Mwifi Application Examples ------------------------

.. _mwifi-application-examples:

Application Examples
--------------------

For ESP-MDF examples, please refer to the directory :example:`function_demo/mwifi`, which includes:

   * Connect to the external network: This can be achieved by the root node via TCP.
   * Routerless: It involves a fixed root node which communicates with the external devices via UART.
   * MQTT example: Implement each node to communicate with the MQTT broker by the root node via MQTT.
   * Channel switching: When the router channel changes, Mesh switches its channel accordingly.(In development)
   * Low power consumption: The leaf nodes stop functioning as softAP and enter into sleep mode.(In development)
