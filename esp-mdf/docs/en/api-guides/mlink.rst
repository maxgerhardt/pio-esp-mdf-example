1. Preparation
---------------

The prerequisite for the ESP-Mesh app to communicate with the ESP-MDF devices is that the device has been successfully networked, and the mobile phone and mesh network are on the same LAN.

 The `ESP-Mesh app <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/apps?keys=&field_technology_tid%5B%5D=18>`_ is hereafter referred to as "app" in this document.

The ESP-MDF devices automatically enter the `networking stage <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-guides/mesh.html#mesh-networking>`_ once configured. If all the networked devices are shown in the ESP-Mesh app, it means that the networking is successful.

2. Communication Process
--------------------------

The root node is the only interface of the mesh network that communicates with external network. To control the devices in the mesh network, the app needs to find the root node; then it obtains the MAC address of all devices in the mesh network from the root node; finally, the root node can communicate with any device on the mesh network.
The whole process is divided into three steps:

1. The app acquires the IP address, Port number and MAC address of the root node.
2. The app inquires a list of the network's devices from the mesh root node.
3. The app and the mesh devices communicate with each other.

3. Communication Protocol
--------------------------

This chapter illustrates the communication protocols involved in the three steps mentioned above. The app gets the list of networked mesh devices, and communicates with devices in the mesh network using the standard HTTP or HTTPS communication protocol. In addition, the communication protocol also includes:

1. Device status notification: This is to allow the users to check the real-time status of the device through the app. That is, when the device status changes, the device will send UDP broadcast packets notifying the app of the changes, and then the app will inquire about the updated status of the device.
2. Local connectivity control: connectivity control between devices on the LAN.

3.1. App Gets the IP Address, Port Number and MAC Address of the Root Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this stage, the root node enables the mDNS service and UDP broadcasting function needed for device discovery. During device discovery, the app obtains the IP address, port number, and MAC address of the root node.

1. mDNS Service for Device Discovery

The app will then acquire the root node's IP address through mDNS service, as well as the corresponding port number and MAC address from the ``port`` and ``txt`` fields of the service info.

    mDNS Service Info::

        hostname: "esp32_mesh"
        instance_name: "mesh"
        service_type: "_mesh-https"
        proto: "_tcp"
        port: 80
        txt:
            key: "mac"
            value: "112233445566"



2. Receiving Broadcast UDP Packets

When scanning for devices, the app broadcasts UDP packets and obtains the information about the root node from its reply.

**Request:**

.. code-block:: none

    "Are You Espressif IOT Smart Device?"

**Response:**

.. code-block:: none

    "ESP32 Mesh 112233445566 http 80"

.. Note::

    * ``112233445566`` is the MAC address of the root node
    * ``80`` is the http service port
    * In addition, the app obtains the IP address of the root node through the UDP packets replied by the root node.

3.2. App Acquires the Device List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Request::**

.. code-block:: none

    GET /mesh_info HTTP/1.1
    Host: 192.168.1.1:80

**Response::**

.. code-block:: none

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: ??
    Mesh-Node-Mac: aabbccddeeff,112233445566,18fe34a1090c
    Host: 192.168.1.1:80

.. Note::

    * ``/mesh_info`` is the app command for abtaining the list of devices, which can be implemented via http URL field;
    * ``Mesh-Node-Mac`` is the list of the node' Station MAC addresses, separated by commas;
    * ``Host`` is a required field of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, indicating the console's IP address and port number.

3.3. App and ESP-MDF Device Communication Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. App Requests Format

**Request::**

.. code-block:: none

    POST /device_request HTTP/1.1
    Content-Length: ??
    Content-Type: application/json
    Root-Response::??
    Mesh-Node-Mac: aabbccddeeff,112233445566
    Host: 192.168.1.1:80

    **content_json**

1. ``/device_request`` is the app command for controlling devices, which, apart from other things, can set and get the device status, via an http request through the URL field.
2. ``Content-Length`` is the length of the http message body.
3. ``Content-Type`` is the data type of the http message body, in the format of ``application/json``.
4. ``Root-Response`` decides whether only replies from the root node are needed. If only the replies from the root node are required, the command will not be forwarded to the mesh devices. Value ``1`` means replies from the root node are required; ``0`` means no reply from the root node is required.

.. Note::

    * ``Host`` is a required field in the HTTP/1.1 protocol, indicating the app’s IP address and port number.
    * ``**content_json**`` is the http message body, corresponding to the ``Request`` in ``3.4. App's Control of ESP-MDF Devices``.

2. Device Replies

    Mesh-Parent-Mac: aabbccddeeff
    Host: 192.168.1.1:80
    \r\n
    **content_json**

1. ``Content-Length`` is the length of the http message body.
2. ``Content-Type`` is the data type of the http message body, in the ``application/json`` format.
3. ``Mesh-Node-Mac`` is the MAC address of the device.
4. ``Mesh-Parent-Mac`` is the MAC address of the device’s parent node.

.. _Device Status Notification:

3.5. Device Status Notification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the status of the ESP-MDF device (on/off), network connection (connected or disconnected), and route table change, the root node will send broadcast UDP packets to notify the app to obtain the latest status of the device.

**UDP Broadcast:**

    mac=112233445566
    flag=1234
    type=***

* ``mac`` is the MAC address of the device whose status has changed;
* ``flag`` is a random integer value used to distinguish among notifications at different times;
* ``type`` is the type of change, including:
* ``status`` indicates that the device status has changed;
* ``https`` indicates that the information of the device connection in the network has changed, and the updated information is required through https communication protocol;
* ``http`` indicates that the information of the device connection in the network has changed, and the updated information is required through http communication protocol;
* ``sniffer`` indicates that a new networked device has been sniffered.
