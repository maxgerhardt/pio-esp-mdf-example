# Mupgrade Example

## Introduction

It introduces a quick way to use `Mupgrade` to upgrade ESP-WIFI-MESH devices.

[Mesh Upgrade Introduction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-mdf/en/latest/api-guides/mupgrade.html)

## Process

### Step 1: Connect to the router

Connect PC to the router that is connected to ESP-WIFI-MESH network.

### Step 2: Run HTTP server

A built-in python HTTP server can be used as the server for the example upgrade.
Open a new terminal to run the HTTP server, and then run the below command to generate the firmware to be upgraded and start the server.

Make:
```shell
cd $MDF_PATH/esp-idf/examples/get-started/hello_world/
export IDF_PATH=$MDF_PATH/esp-idf/
make
cd build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8070
```

CMake:
```shell
cd $MDF_PATH/esp-idf/examples/get-started/hello_world/
export IDF_PATH=$MDF_PATH/esp-idf/
idf.py build
cd build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8070
```

While running the server, you may go to `http：// localhost：8070/` to browse the build directory.

>> Note:
	1. The above command may vary from systems. For some systems, the last command line may be `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8070`.
	2. As you may have noticed, the `hello-world` example doesn't appear anything special when it is used for OTA upgrade. This is because any application files built by ESP-MDF can be used as the application image for OTA.
	3. If there are firewall softwares that prevent any access to the port 8070, please grant the access while the example is running.

### Step 3: Build an OTA example

Navigate to the OTA example directory, and type `make menuconfig`(Make) or `idf.py menuconfig`(CMake) to configure the OTA example. Under the submenu "Example Configuration", please fill in the following information:

* ESP-WIFI-MESH network configuration information
* Firmware upgrade URL, which would look like this:

```
https://<host-ip-address>:<host-port>/<firmware-image-filename>

for e.g,
https://192.168.0.3:8070/hello-world.bin
```
Save the changes and type `make`(Make) or `idf.py build`(CMake) to build the example.

### Step 4: Flash the OTA example

When downloading the flash, please firstly use `erase_flash` to erase the entire flash memory (all the remaining data in ota_data partition will be deleted as well), and then write the followings via a serial port:

Make:
```shell
make erase_flash flash
```

CMake:
```shell
idf.py erase_flash flash
```

### Step 5: Run the OTA example

When the example starts up, it will print "Starting OTA example..." then:

1. Connect to the AP with configured SSID and password.
2. Connect to the HTTP server and download the new image.
3. Write the image to flash, and configure the next boot from this image.
4. Reboot

## Troubleshooting

* Check your PC can ping the ESP32 at its IP, and that the IP, AP and other configuration settings are correct in menuconfig.
* Check if any firewall software is preventing incoming connections on the PC.
* Check whether you can get firmware (default hello-world.bin), by checking the output of following command:

 ```
 curl -v https：// <host-ip-address>：<host-port> / <firmware-image-filename>
 ```

* If you have another PC or a phone, try viewing the file listing from the separate host.

### errors “ota_begin error err = 0x104”

If you see this error then check that the configured (and actual) flash size is large enough for the partitions in the partition table. The default "two OTA slots" partition table only works with 4 MB flash size. To use OTA with smaller flash sizes, create a custom partition table CSV (look in components/partition_table) and configure it in menuconfig.

## Note

In order to allow more nodes to join the mesh network for firmware upgrade, example will start the firmware upgrade after 10 seconds.
