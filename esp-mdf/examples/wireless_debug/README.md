# ESP-NOW Debug Receiver Board Demo

ESP-NOW debug receiver board can receive debugging data from ESP-WIFI-MESH devices only when the board is on the same Wi-Fi channel with the devices.

</div>

> Note:
> 1. If the ESP-NOW debug receiver board is on the same channel with ESP-WIFI-MESH network, you don't need to connect the borad with the router.
> 2. The following code needs to be added to the monitored ESP-WIFI-MESH device:
>    ```c
>    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mdebug_console_init());
>    MDF_ERROR_ASSERT(mdebug_espnow_init());
>    mdebug_cmd_register_common();
>    ```

ESP-NOW debug receiver board provides the following features:

 - [SD card file management](#Commands-for-SD-Card-Files): lists all files in current SD card, deletes specific files, and prints file contents optionally in some formats such as hex, string or base64.
 
 - [Sniffer listening for surrounding IEEE 802.11 packages](#Sniffer-Command): captures packages and saves them in pcap format in SD card, specifies the name of the file to save captured packages, sets package filters, and specifies a channel to listen for.
 
 - [Wi-Fi configuration](#Wi-Fi-Command): sets Wi-Fi information needed in STA mode, including router SSID, password, BSSID and work channel, and saves/erases the configuration information.
 
 - [Wi-Fi scan](#Scan-Command): works in STA mode, and scans AP or ESP-WIFI-MESH devices nearby, sets filters such as filtered by RSSI, SSID or BSSID, and sets passive scan time in each channel. 

 - [Log configuration](#Log-Command): monitors logs from other devices, counts the numbers of various logs (I, W, E), restart times and coredump times and displays them on the screen, adds/removes monitors, and sets logging level.
  
 - [Coredump information management](#Coredump-Command): checks with the specific device whether there is coredump information, receives/erases coredump information, and requests to receive coredump information with specific sequence numbers.

 - [Command](#Command-<"command">): runs commands on specific devices.
 
 - [General command](#Other-Command): includes help command to print all currently supported commands.

## ESP-NOW Introduction

### Overview

ESP-NOW debug receiver board receives running log and coredump data from ESP-WIFI-MESH devices via [ESP-NOW](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/wifi/esp_now.html) wireless transmission technology. ESP-NOW is a connectionless Wi-Fi protocol defined by Espressif, widely used in smart lighting, remote control, sensors and other fields. In ESP-NOW, data is encapsulated in Wi-Fi Action frame for data transmission, transferring data from one Wi-Fi device to another without connection.

### ESP-NOW Features

1. The sender and the receiver must be on the same channel.
2. The receiver may not add the MAC address of the sender in the case of non-encrypted communication (MAC address is needed in encrypted communication), but the sender must add the MAC address of the receiver.
3. ESP-NOW can add up to 20 paired devices, and supports six of these devices to encrypt communications.
4. Register callback functions to receive data packages, and check the delivery status (succeed or fail).
5. Ensure data security by CTR and CCBC-MAC protocol (CCMP).

> For more information about ESP-NOW, please refer to [ESP-NOW Instructions](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/wifi/esp_now.html) and ESP-IDF example [espnow](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/wifi/espnow)

### Workflow

1. Compile and flash this project to an ESP32 development board;
2. Open serial port terminal and restart development board, you will get the following information in the terminal:

<div align=center>
<img src="terminal_log.png"  width="800">
<p> Serial Port Terminal </p>
</div>

> Please use serial port terminals such as `minicom` to avoid some unexpected problems when using `make monitor`.

3. Debug ESP-WIFI-MESH by entering the following commands according to the prompts.

* The following describes the use of each command in sequence.

### Serial Port Commands

* ESP-NOW debug receiver board supports the following serial port commands: help, sdcard, wifi_sniffer, wifi_config, wifi_scan, log, coredump and command.

* The interaction of serial port commands follows the following rules:
    1. PC sends commands to ESP-NOW debug receiver board through serial port with a baud rate of 115200.
    2. In command definition, all characters are lowercase (some options are uppercase), and strings do not need to be quoted.
    3. The elements in brackets {} in command description should be taken as a parameter and be replaced as the case may be.
    4. The part contained in square brackets [] in command description is the default value and can be filled in or displayed.
    5. The pattern of serial port commands is shown below, with each element separated by a space:

        ```
        Command ＋ Option ＋ Parameter，for example: log -s aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
        ```

    6. Serial port commands support line breaks: '\n' and '\r\n'.
    7. Serial port returns execution results at a baud rate of 115200.

## Impact on Performance

Since ESP-NOW, like ESP-WIFI-MESH, uses a Wi-Fi interface to send and receive data packages, delay may occur in receiving commands or in data transmission if there is a large amount of data to be transmitted among ESP-WIFI-MESH devices.

By testing in a good network, we provide the following thresholds, and with such configuration parameters, the delay caused to ESP-WIFI-MESH devices is negligible.

* Fifty ESP-WIFI-MESH devices (The more the devices, the worse the network.)
* Add `10` ESP-WIFI-MESH devices to ESP-NOW receiver (The more the devices added to the receiver, the worse the network may be.)
* Set logging level to `info` (The lower the level, the worse the network may be.)
